# Simple Shell
This project is the most important of the first trimester of ALX School, is the consolidation of everything we learned in the quarter about System engineering & DevOps and Low-level programming & Algorithm. Using C programming language, we develop our own Shell.

## Description
The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

## Installation
You can install the simple shell cloning this repo:

- `$ git clone https://github.com/AishaKhalfan/simple_shell.git`
Next you can compile the files with this command:

- `$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
finally you can run our Shell writing:


## Built with
This project was built and development with:

- C programming language: is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.

- VirtualBox: VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.

- Vagrant: Managing virtual machine environments.

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: Operating system tester and working.

- GCC: GNU Compiler version 4.8.4
